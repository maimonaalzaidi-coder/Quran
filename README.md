Quran App – Graduation Project

Project Overview
Quran App is a small iOS application developed as a graduation project. The application displays a
list of Quran reciters fetched from a public API and allows users to view reciter details and play
Quran recitations.

The project focuses on clean code structure, proper separation of concerns, and correct handling of
UI and data.


Architecture Choice
The application follows the MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) architecture.

This architecture was chosen to: Separate UI from business logic Improve code readability and
maintainability Make the project easier to understand and extend Project Structure
App – Application entry point
UI – SwiftUI views and screens
Data – Models and API services
Shared – Reusable helpers


Technologies Used
Swift
SwiftUI
MVVM Architecture
URLSession for networking
AVPlayer for audio playback
